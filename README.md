Quadratic Functional Graph Isomorphism Checker

The quadratic functional graph isomorphism checker takes a prime number and checks to see if any of the associated functional graphs are isomorphic. Uploads will be coming over the next few days.

Place a list of primes in a folder called "list/list.prime" under the source directory.
